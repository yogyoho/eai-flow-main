    """Return whether the tuple is a metadata-only run-duration checkpoint.

    ``persist_run_history_metadata`` (``deerflow.runtime.runs.worker``) is the
    only writer of these checkpoints. It stamps
    ``metadata["writes"]["runtime_run_duration"]``, and the memory and SQLite
    savers round-trip that marker unchanged — so whenever ``writes`` is
    present it is authoritative: its per-writer key classifies the leaf
    exactly (a title or goal leaf carries ``runtime_interrupt_title`` /
    ``goal``, a graph step carries its channel writes, and none of them is a
    duration checkpoint).

    The Postgres savers instead funnel metadata through langgraph's
    ``get_serializable_checkpoint_metadata``, which pops ``writes`` before
    the row lands (``langgraph/checkpoint/postgres/aio.py``; no other saver
    calls it) — so on Postgres the marker never comes back and every duration
    checkpoint would look like an addressable state to the replay and history
    paths. The writer's index keys (``run_durations`` and
    ``run_message_ids``) and ``source == "update"`` do survive that round
    trip, but they are not proof on their own: ``_ensure_interrupted_title``
    and ``write_thread_goal`` copy the head's metadata and thereby inherit
    the stamps while changing a real channel. The fallback therefore also
    requires the duration writer's shape — it clones the parent's
    ``channel_versions`` verbatim (``id``/``ts`` only), while a state-changing
    leaf bumps at least one version — which is what passing ``parent``
    enables. Without a resolvable parent the stamps are refused: the cost of
    scanning one metadata-only copy is a state-equivalent base, the cost of
    skipping a goal leaf is the goal itself.

    Langgraph's ``update_state`` paths (rollback restore, compaction, manual
    updates) cannot inherit the stamps at all: they persist metadata built
    from scratch (``{"source": "update", "step", "parents", ...}``), and
    ``get_checkpoint_metadata`` merges only scalar values from config
    metadata, so dict-valued stamps never leak in either.

    Destructive callers must not rely on the fallback — pass
    ``stamp_fallback=False`` and confirm by shape instead, as
    ``checkpoint_retention._mark_duration_leaves_without_the_marker`` does.
