# Serper provider

`tools.py` owns web/image search. Keep model-facing arguments unchanged.
Web-only `include_domains`/`exclude_domains` use at most 10 domain-only entries
per list; normalize case, one trailing dot and IDNA, reject invalid configuration
before transport, log validation errors without config/query values, and enforce
exact-host/dot-subdomain matching with deny precedence.
Google `site:` query operators are best-effort; local URL-host filtering is
mandatory even for queries containing operators. Never truncate restrictions,
refill results, or relax scope. The composed query limit is 500 characters;
report the cleaned original query and actual filtered count, including zero.
Image search and unconfigured web behavior retain their existing contracts.
This is source selection, not a fetch policy or factuality check.

Resolve endpoints once in `_serper_post`, before transport setup: a usable
per-tool `base_url` takes precedence over `SERPER_BASE_URL`, then the existing
Serper endpoint. Strip surrounding whitespace and trailing slashes. Require an
absolute HTTP(S) URL with a host and valid port; reject query/fragment markers,
including empty ones, before HTTP without echoing configured values.
Read each tool's config once and pass captured extras to key resolution,
including an empty mapping when config is absent, to keep endpoint/key paired
through hot reload. Settings stay operator-only. Send keys
only via `X-API-KEY`, and preserve result URL validation and model arguments.
Retries must reuse the resolved endpoint across attempts. Debug endpoint
diagnostics omit URL credentials, query and fragment; result-URL guards do not
restrict the operator's API host.

Tests: `backend/tests/test_serper_domain_filters.py`, `test_serper_tools.py` and
`test_serper_endpoints.py`.
Diagnostic tests cover plain logs and the shared `UrlRedactionFilter`; root
handlers can redact paths. Assert full endpoint routing on the captured HTTP
request, and verify diagnostic host/port and credential omission in both modes.
Mock HTTP; live Serper semantics remain unverified. See
`backend/docs/CONFIGURATION.md#serper-source-filters` for the operator contract.

`_serper_post` owns default-off physical retries (0–3) and one monotonic
scheduling budget (>0–300s), not cancellation of synchronous I/O. Keep config
validation before transport and retry only connect failures, 502/503/504 and
hinted 429. Provider-local hint parsing avoids coupling to Jina. Whole-tool
extension hooks cannot isolate this boundary. Test with real MockTransport
through both tools in `backend/tests/test_serper_retries.py`.
Endpoint/retry regressions change configuration and environment during backoff;
every attempt must keep the original provider URL, API key and request payload.
Budget aborts before and after backoff log a warning identifying the stage,
without query/key values, and preserve the last structured error. Date tests
pin asctime UTC anchoring (under a non-UTC host timezone where supported) and
the RFC 850 50-year cutoff down to the second.
