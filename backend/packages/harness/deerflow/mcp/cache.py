    performs only the staleness check:

      or in flight, so a process that never initialized MCP tools pays no
      config-hashing cost. A process that did publish a cache (including an
      empty one) — or already installed a binding epoch — still pays one
      stat+sha256 of the config file per call to check for staleness;
    * it invalidates an in-flight initialization (bumping the cache generation)
      when the observed revision no longer matches what discovery was handed, so
      tools discovered under a superseded config cannot publish;
